Difference between  HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1 
- It was discovered on 1989 as a communication standard for the WWW
- This protocol transfers information between a client computer and a web server using GET method
- using GET method the client computer requests an information to the server via text
- In response server send an HTML page 
- Not all the resources are sent in the first call of data
- The reuqest and response will go back and forth until all the necessary resources are received to render the HTML page


HTTP2

- It began as an SPDY protocol and developed by Google primarily
- This version was created to reduce the latency using compression, Multiplexing and prioritaization
- This distingusies itself from HTTP1 by Binary framing layer
- HTTP1 keeps all request and responses in plain text format whereas HTTP2 encapsulates all messages using Binary framing layer
- An application level API would still create messages in HTTP format
- But the underlying layer would convert this messages into Binary
- This helps the web application created before HTTP2 can continue functioning as normal when interacting with new protocol



Objects:-

Everything in Java is an Object
- It is represented by {}
The values can be represented by key:value,

Syntax:

Var obj = {
    key1:value1,
    key2:value2,
    key3:value3,
    key4:value4,
}


Objects can be accessed using dot operator or square bracker []

For example: conside the below Object

var studentDetails = {
    Name:"Santosh Kumar",
    Age:25,
    Gender:"Male"
}

To access the keys on the object it can be called using the below term

studentDetails.Name
studentDetails.Age

or

studentDetails["Name"]


Inserting an Key in Object

studentdDetails.emailid = "XYZ@gmail.com"

The above inserts an key value in the Object


Deleting an Key in Object

delete studentdDetails.Age
